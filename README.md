## Introduction

This package gives you a set of conventions to make the most out of [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) in Laravel.

#### Inspiration

This package was inspired by the [Turbo Rails gem](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails).

#### Bootcamp

If you want a more hands-on introduction, head out to [Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.turbo-laravel.com). It covers building a multi-platform app in Turbo.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Turbo Laravel can be found on the [Turbo Laravel website](https://turbo-laravel.com).

### Changelog

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what has changed recently.

### Contributing

We're using [Workbench](https://github.com/orchestral/workbench), so we have a companion Laravel app for local development of the package living in the [workbench/](../workbench/) at the root level.

You may run the Workbench app like this:

```bash
composer serve
```

After that, the app should be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
